# DiaMLP---Diabetes-Classification-with-Multilayer-Perceptron/ANN
Diabetes Classification using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a binary classification problem where the goal is to predict whether a patient has diabetes (positive class) or not (negative class) based on a set of biomedical features or risk factors.
Dataset:
The dataset used for this task typically contains a set of input features (biomedical measurements) and a binary target variable (0 or 1, indicating non-diabetic or diabetic, respectively). Commonly, the dataset contains attributes such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI (Body Mass Index), age, etc.

Objective:
The main objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic based on the provided features. The MLP classifier is used for this purpose because it can learn complex non-linear relationships in the data.

Steps to Perform Diabetes Classification using MLP:

Import Libraries: Begin by importing the required Python libraries, such as pandas for data handling, scikit-learn for machine learning, and matplotlib/seaborn for data visualization.

Load and Explore Data: Load the dataset and explore its structure, check for missing values, and get statistical summaries.

Preprocessing: Prepare the data for modeling by separating features (input variables) from the target variable. Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

Feature Scaling: Since MLPs are sensitive to the scale of input features, perform feature scaling, typically using standardization, to ensure all features have a similar scale.

Create and Train MLP Classifier: Build the MLP model with one or more hidden layers. Tune hyperparameters like the number of hidden neurons and layers, learning rate, and maximum iterations.

Model Training: Train the MLP classifier using the training data.

Model Evaluation: After training, evaluate the model's performance on the test data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Interpret Results: Analyze the classification results to understand the model's effectiveness in predicting diabetic and non-diabetic cases. Explore misclassifications and make necessary adjustments if required.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the MLP model by performing hyperparameter optimization, such as using grid search or random search.

Deployment: After achieving satisfactory performance, deploy the model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Conclusion:
Diabetes Classification using MLP is a powerful technique to identify patients at risk of diabetes based on their biomedical features. With careful data preprocessing and model tuning, an MLP classifier can provide accurate predictions and help in early diagnosis and proactive healthcare management for patients with diabetes.
